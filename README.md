# Attendance-management
Attendance management is the process of efficient prevention of employee time theft by
maintaining and tracking employee working hours, login and logout time. Organizations and
Institutions use a number of techniques, from punching cards, maintaining spreadsheets to
automated attendance systems by using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Algorithms and biometric devices (Internet Of Things).
